## Graph library for Lean 4

This is a graph library for the upcoming 4th version of Lean. More documentation to be added soon.

## Example use

To help you get started with using this library see [this](https://github.com/PeterKementzey/example-lean4-pkg-using-Graph) example project I made. Currently it is using an older version of the library, it will be updated soon.
